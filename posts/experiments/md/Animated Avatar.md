I've always wanted to bring life to the most simple design element possible. Using only code.

When I stumbled upon Nicolas' small avatar in the footer of his [portfolio](https://web.archive.org/web/20250516084155/https://slrncl.com/), I knew it was exactly what I'd been looking for. It was simple, sleek and was already slightly animated. The subtle head and eye movements already made it alive.

I then played around for a bit, and created a dozen more animations with keyframes in CSS. It's incredible to see how much emotion you can give to a simple design element: 1 circle, 2 dots and a gradient.

Here it is, in all its glory:
