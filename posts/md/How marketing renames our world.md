All the words we use every day have a story behind them; that’s etymology. But some words have surprisingly recent origins.

I recently learned that the word *podcast* comes from Apple’s world: podcast = iPod + broadcast. The term itself was coined around 2004 (and then Apple helped push it mainstream), and now it’s just… a normal word everywhere. Isn’t it crazy?

I wanted to find more of these words we assume have been around for centuries, but were actually invented not that long ago.

*Trampoline*, for example, started as a trademark around the late 1930s/early 1940s—basically a new, marketable name for what was also described more generically as a “rebound tumbler” device. (The name itself was inspired by the Spanish *trampolín*.) “Trampoline” was definitely easier to sell, and I’m glad it stuck and got into everyday language.

We could also talk about *escalator* (originally a trademark), *heroin* (a brand name in its early commercial life), or the more obvious and well-known Bluetooth; but I think you’ve got the idea.

Our vocabulary is full of things that started as brands, inventions, or marketing tricks before becoming “just words” in our language. There’s even a name for that: **genericide**.
