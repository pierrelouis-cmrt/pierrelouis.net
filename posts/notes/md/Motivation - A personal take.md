I’m thinking a lot about motivation. I believe it’s something you can work on. Definitely.

But the concept of motivation itself is kinda hard to grasp and even comprehend. So is there a proper way to summon motivation as a whole? Or should I focus on finding near objectives and goals to give a place/state to move my life to?

When I look at where my motivation actually comes from, I realise how different it can be from person to person. For some people, a source of motivation can be fear, fame and failure itself.

For me, it’s the opposite: fear grips my mind and I feel like I’m almost paralyzed. It’s a very weird feeling.

I’m guilty of not working as much as I’d like to, but at the same time I’m too afraid to start working and thus maybe failing. I just need to accept the fact that the path to the life I want won’t be perfect, and that everywhere I mess up should help me learn how to deal with difficult things.

After some head-scratching, my motivation sources revealed themselves. It’s tech: working in tech, living in tech, living for tech. And design, of course; but design is everywhere anyway. I’m studying engineering in a way that stays pretty general, to open doors to lots of different careers and domains. This is what’s hard. I’ll do tech, I’ll do what I like most, but only later in my studies. For now I just need to keep that in mind and keep working hard for the future; for my future.
