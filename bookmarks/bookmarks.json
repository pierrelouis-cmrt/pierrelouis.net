Tesla's data shows that vehicles with FSD engaged are involved in significantly fewer accidents than those without (7 times less!).

This article explores how robots could feel by only exploiting a few internal sensors on each limb/joint. Those sensors would measure the force/torque applied to them, and compute the exact contact points causing those forces. It even works when the robot gets touched in multiple places at the same time!",
